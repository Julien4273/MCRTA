# MCRTA

Install required packages in your environment with : **pip install -r requirements.txt** <br />
Enter : python **your_path/mcrta_6.py** to launch the program. <br />
We tried to write this program the more userfriendly possible. You can change the density by uncommenting the line you want with a n (among the first lines). <br />
Then you can change the number of photons and the probability of absorption or Compton scattering. <br />
Plots will be saved in the working directory.  <br />
