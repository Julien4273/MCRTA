# MCRTA

Install required packages in your environment with : **pip install -r requirements.txt** <br />
Enter : **python your_path/mcrta_6.py** to launch the program. <br />
We tried to write this program the more userfriendly possible. In the script, the second cell (called "parameters user can change") is where you can change the number of photons and the probability of absorption or Compton scattering. <br />
You can change the geometry as well by uncommenting the line with geo you want. <br />
In the third cell, you can change the density by uncommenting the line with a n (choose between low, medium or high density).  <br />
Plots will be saved in the working directory.  <br />
